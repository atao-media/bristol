.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bristoljackstats
.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBbristoljackstats\fP is an ancillary program for the bristol emulator suite
which requests the jack engine start itself and report its target sampling rate
and period size. These are needed a priori by bristol so have to be evaluated
in advance. The program is not intended for general use, it is called by the
startBristol process as the emulator environment is created.
