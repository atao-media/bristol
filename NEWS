    0.10.11 27 Oct 2007 Arpeggiator written into the MIDI library.

Added arpeggiation (actually an arpeggiating sequencer) into MIDI library.

    0.10.10 XX Oct 2007 Bass pedalboard integration for Hammond.

Added a third manual to the hammond.
Built in the GM-2 MIDI controller mappings to a range of the emulations.

    0.10.9 16 Sept 2007 Reworked installation procedures, Vox-300

Vox dual manual 300.

    0.10.8 01 Sept 2007 Realistic Concertmate, recolorations, fixes

Developed a Realistic/Moog Concertmate MG1.
Diverse fixes and recolorations.

    0.10.7 29 July 2007 added roadrunner electric piano

Two rounds of GUI optimisation have improved the CPU load by a couple of orders
of magnitude.

Added a grey scale option.

Added antialiasing features (that had been previously dropped as too CPU
intensive, now quite reasonable).

    0.10.5 06 June 2007 added roadrunner electric piano

The Roadrunner is an emulated organ circuit electric piano, many of these were
released in the 70's and complemented the string machines. They used clock 
divided organ circuitry and simple envelope generators per key to groom to 
something approaching a piano envelope.

Diverse minor bugfixes.

    0.10.4 24 May 2007 added Solina string machine

Potentials:
Some of the diverse synth memories are damaged.
ARP 2600 has damaged vertical patch cables.
Move the key mappings and controller mappings to .mcm file as they are static.
Removed clipping in new keyclick generation.

    0.10.3 18 May 2007 added the following

Modifications to configure.ac and Makefile.am to correct autotools errors.
Corrected use of --exec_prefix for configure process.

Note velocity, Poly and Channel Pressure curve mappings from file. Global.
Note integer index mapping in same configuration file. Global.
Note Microtonal tunings. Global settings - affects the whole engine.

Note velocity map - per emulation.
Note microtonal map - per emulation.

B3 key noise generated per bus with configurable delays and gain per contact.
Reverse controller motion of hammond drawbars (mappings?).

Controller mapped value curves for lin/log/exp/parabolic with inverse table.

Resolved issues with use of '-jack' flag as opposed to '-audio jack'.

More keyboard velocity curves of which one mapping per emulation.

Pitch bend damaged by microtonal mapping implementation, fixed.

    0.10.2: 10 May 2007

Changes to automake configuration files for installation prefixes.

    0.10.1: 4 May 2007

Probable first distribution of the bristol version using GNU autotools.
