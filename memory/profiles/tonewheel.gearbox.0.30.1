# This it the bristol-0.30 grungy gearbox
#
# This file defines the diverse tonewheel generator parameters for the bristol
# preacher algorithm. There are definitions per wheel that define its gain and
# waveform, the gain levels for each of the slider busses, frequency, phase and
# crosstalk levels betweem all the compartments. The tone gain can be
# seen to equalise the whole keyboard and the bus gains to equalise ane given
# note. There are also settings per slide bar bus for linearity.
#
# The selection between bright and normal is from the GUI "bright" button.
#
# Wheel damping is also known as 'volume stealing', 'volume robbing', etc, it
# defines how much signal loss occurs if the same tonewheel is tapped twice 
# for any chord combination. The Hammond did not drive all the possible note
# combinations linearly, so using the same wheel twice did not necessarily 
# double the volume, it would tailer off slightly. The GUI controls the overall
# amount of damping, this controls the mapping of the damping over the keyboard.
#
# There are 91 wheels [0..90], 9 slider busses [0..9], the ordering is not
# relevant and any undefined entries are interpolated between the nearest
# defined boundaries. Upper and lower extremes are leveled to the nearest
# defined value when not explicitly specified.
#
# There are the following options:
#
#	ToneNormal: <wheel> <waveform>  - tonewheel waveform normal
#	ToneBright: <wheel> <waveform>  - tonewheel waveform bright
#
#	EQNormal: <wheel> <gain>  - relative gain for that wheel in normal setting
#	EQBright: <wheel> <gain>  - relative gain for that wheel in bright setting
#
#	DampNormal: <wheel> <gain>	- relative damping of wheel, normal setting
#	DampBright: <wheel> <gain>	- relative damping of wheel, bright setting
#
#	BusNormal: <bus> <gain>	- relative gain of slider busses, normal setting
#	BusBright: <bus> <gain>	- relative gain of slider busses, bright setting
#
# Use whatver values you want however anything <= 0 is ignored.
#
# Waveforms are as follows:
#
#	1.0 - sinewave.
#	> 1 - tends towards ramp wave (5.0 has a quite sharp leading edge)
#	< 1 - tends towards square (0.0 is a rather sharp edged square wave)
#
# The defaults amplify the bass and treble frequencies, using a slight square
# wave for the low frequencies moving up to ramps for the high end.
#
# This file is reread when the compress option is selected from the GUI
# although this button does not actually affect the sound quality of the
# preacher (it does affect the sound when the preacher is not selected).
# Reloads are quite an intensive operation since all 91 wheel waveforms are
# recalculated. Avoid them whilst actively playing, but you can adust the
# values without having to restart the engine and test the net results, plus
# changing the 'bright' button setting will have no impact on performance
# since the differences are precalculated.
#

# Tonewheel waveforms, lower end are flatter to be a little hollow. This may
# be incorrect since using a bright, higher frequency response would typically
# result in the lower frequency waves having a richer content. The ranges 
# should be fixed such that the waveforms for the tooths are common by number
# of teeth - there were 12 of each: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 plus 6 of 192
# The output waveforms for each of these ranges should be comparable.

#
# These can redefine the Hammond 'almost' Even Tempered frequencies and the

# here we are going to add additional flatness on the 192-toothed wheels.
#
# Default phase is to init totally randomly, this is pretty much how the
# Hammond operated - the teeth were located by spring friction only and could
# wander with transport as the wheel could 'walk' under vibration. Phase should
# not affect the sound, but actually it does. If you don't like the random
# change between invocations then they can be fixed here. Either way, you do
# not want to go for all the wheels to be totally in phase, that would be very

# And the compartment table. These are the note numbers (Hammond counted from
# 1, but as we all know that does not work well for computers) in each of
# the 24 compartments. Each compartment had a pair of tonewheels at each side
# and there was more crosstalk between these two than the far two at the other
# side of the compartment due to distance. Note that these are not the same as
# the MIDI note numbers from KeyOn events, but internal 'tooth' indeces.
#
# These chamber definitions should be correct but if you see any discrepencies
# let me know. Each tonewheel was in a compartment with 3 other octaves of the
# same note and there were two compartments for any given key covering either
# seven or eight octaves. Some notes had empty top frequency tonewheels since
# the then engineering could not put enough teeth on the wheel, these were
# dealt with using foldback from lower frequencies (and the lowest octave also
# had foldback from one octave above for slightly different related reasons).
#
# Crosstalk '0' is used between the first pair and the last pair - they are the
# adjacent wheels. The other two crosstalk are for the opposite pair and could
# really have been consolidated into a single value.
#
# Crosstalk level-3 is used for bus crosstalk of the drawbars.
#
# For example, from the first line:
#
# Wheel 0 has crosstalk from 48 at level0, plus 12 at level1 and 60 at level2.
# Wheel 48 has crosstalk from 0 at level0, plus 60 at level1 and 12 at level2.
# Wheel 12 has crosstalk from 60 at level0, plus 0 at level1 and 48 at level2.
# Wheel 60 has crosstalk from 12 at level0, plus 48 at level1 and 0 at level2.
#
# These lines can be extended to include the crosstalk levels if you want to 
# redefine them per wheel.

# Adjacency table. Each wheel, apart from being in a shared compartment which
# created crosstalk was also on a filter board with different notes in its
# vicinity and in a wire loom with various adjacent cables. There are another
# four entries in the crosstalk table for these values, the default given
# here are for the filter adjacency, but the fact is these can be redefined for
# arbitrary wheel numbers if you want to create a loom. Again, the crosstalk
# values are optional and override the defaults.
#
# The default adjacency table is actually taken from the above compartment table
# as the filter circuits were mounted on the outside, hence, wheel 30 in
# compartment 13 had 4 main neighbors, these being 6, 1 and 49 and 54. The
# crosstalk between these will follow the default values unless otherwise
# defined. The adjacency for wheel zero is given as reference as it only has
# two adjacent filters.

#
# Drawbar equalisation.
#
# The tapering table controls the wheel gains by drawbar. It works after the
# wheel EQ given above and actually gives a different mix by drawbar by key.
# Again, this should follow the actual tapering schematics although the values
# used may need to be different as these translate again into linear gains.
#
# If these look wrong let me know, they were taken from the schematics of one
# Hammond model. You can emulate broken stops by giving that stop value a very
# large impedence - 1000, 2000, etc.
#
# The original circuit was a resistive divider with the output signal over 
# a 24 Ohms impedence. The values that are entered here are the net signal
# gain/loss or a resistor index. The index makes it easier to change the 
# settings globally without needing a degree in 'vi'. The reason both formats
# are accepted is that one is easier to define, the other is more flexible 
# and will allow resistor tolerances to be built in to be less mechanical.
#
# taper: note <16'> <5 1/3'> <8'> <4'> <2 2/3'> <2'> <1 3/5'> <1 1/3'> <1'>
#
# There is one entry per note from 0 to 60 for a C to C keyboard. Values outside
# this range are undefined.
#
# The default taper table is:

# resistors: 100  50  34  24  15  10

#
# With the values given above the below three lines are ~equivalent, they use

# KeyClick section. The preacher has its own keyclick emulation. Each key has
# 9 contacts, one for each drawbar bus, and each will make a contact at a 
# slightly different time due to wear and creep of the contacts. This is 
# emulated with a millisecond offset timer from the note_on event such that
# each bus has its own delay before two things happen:
#
# 1: contact is made and the tonewheel finally passes to the output.
# 2: click is generated at a specified level.
#
# The gain levels apply to the noise level from that single contact, they may
# be different but always apply to the same offset timer. The timers are fixed,
# however there is no link between the offset and the drawbar, they are 
# mildly randomised, partly by index selection but also by key velocity - these
# are the maximum offsets, when a key is hit faster then it moves faster and
# the contact delays compress, as with the original instrument (almost - if
# you want to know the differences then mail me).
#
# Gains can be inverted on selection, and the pulse from each contact can be
# controlled from a limited selection.
#
# There are currently 6 waveforms: 0 to 2 are sines of different frequencies,
# 3 is a pulse wave edged with noise, 4 and 5 are ramped waves with different
# attack and decay characteristics.
#
# The overall level of keyclick also has a control in the GUI. All these values
# use the drawbar number as index.
#
# There is currently no NoteOff grooming (0.10.2).
