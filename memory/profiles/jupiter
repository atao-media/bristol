#
# This the the MIDI controller profile, it keeps controller remappings for
# converting one controller ID to another, and then defines which controllers
# are tracked by which GUI devices. It may be edited manually, in which case
# changes are maintained but the GUI can also alter the controller tracking
# by typing <Control><Middle Mouse Button>, the moving the desired control
#
# The KM links your computer keyboard into MIDI note of/off events.
#
# Remap format is "CM: MidiCC   MidiCC"
# Keyboard map format is "KM: ASCII   MIDI_note [MIDI_chan]"
# Control format is "CC: MidiCC   panel/index [value]"
#
# The values are integers from 0 to 16384, the fine resolution controller
# value for the throw of this controller. If in doubt use the value 16383,
# it is only relevant for ganging controllers.
